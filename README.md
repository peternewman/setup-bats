  build:
    name: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

      - name: Setup BATS
        uses: mig4/setup-bats@master
        with:
          bats-version: 1.1.0

      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v1

      - name: Test
        run: bats -r .
```

### Hacking 🧰

#### Building

Install the dependencies  

``` bash
$ npm install
```

Build the typescript

```bash
$ npm run build
```

Run the tests :heavy_check_mark:  

```bash
$ npm test
...
 PASS  __tests__/installer.test.ts

    ✓ Acquires version of BATS if no matching version is installed (1051ms)
    ✓ Throws if no matching version of BATS can be found (674ms)
```

#### Code

The `action.yml` file defines the inputs and output, description, etc. of the
action.

See the documentation:

- [Metadata syntax](https://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions)
- [Toolkit](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/README.md#packages)

#### Publishing to a distribution branch

Actions are run from GitHub repos. It's recommended for users to only refer to
release branches instead of consuming master directly. To create a release
branch, you'd normally do:

``` bash
$ git checkout -b releases/v1
$ npm prune --production
$ git add node_modules
$ git commit -a -m "Release v1"
```

However some of that is automated using [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
git hooks, so it's enough to just do:

``` bash
$ git checkout -b releases/v1
sed -i '/^node_modules/s/^/#/' .gitignore
# update README.md to refer to @v1
$ git commit -a -m "Release v1"
$ git push origin releases/v1
```

The action is now published! :rocket: 

See the [versioning documentation](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md)
